    <h2>HISTORY
    </h2>
    <p>Water Rafting, founded in 2008, began as a small venture initiated by a group of passionate rafters eager to share their love for white-water adventures. Starting with just a handful of boats and a single river route, it quickly gained a reputation for thrilling yet safe experiences. Over the years, Water Rafting expanded, adding new routes, professional guides, and a commitment to environmental conservation, solidifying its place as a trusted name in the rafting community by 2025.</p>
